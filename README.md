Java, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, is
renowned for its adaptability in creating a diverse range of applications, from
mobile apps to desktop software. However, this ubiquity brings about a substantial
cybersecurity challenge: Java-based systems are increasingly susceptible to
malicious intent. Malware poses a persistent threat to cybersecurity, endangering
both individuals and organizations with the risk of data breaches, financial losses,
and reputational damage.
The ominous nature of this threat landscape arises from its ever-evolving character.
Malware authors continuously employ innovative tactics to evade detection
mechanisms, often exploiting vulnerabilities within Java-based systems. In this
context, traditional malware detection techniques struggle to keep pace, rendering
many existing solutions inadequate for the task at hand.
Conventional antivirus software primarily relies on signature-based detection,
which involves comparing known malware patterns with system files.
Nevertheless, the Java ecosystem introduces unique complexities to this approach.
A key challenge lies in the realm of static analysis, where the bytecode of Java
programs, representing the intermediate form of Java code, can be dynamically
generated at runtime and obfuscated in various ways. These challenges necessitate
a fresh perspective in the realm of malware detection.
This project seeks to address these challenges by developing an innovative
approach to malware detection. It leverages the capabilities of the Soot Compiler
Framework to conduct static analysis on Java bytecode, aiming to identify
indicators of compromise amidst the intricacies of dynamically generated and
obfuscated code. By exploring the intricacies of static analysis, this research strives
to enhance our understanding of the unique challenges posed by Java-based
malware detection.
